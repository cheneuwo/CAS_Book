    "# Introduction to Computer-Integrated Interventional Medicine\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer-integrated interventional medicine is an interdisciplinary research area where computerized techniques are applied to every aspect of interventional medicine. A close analogy is the design and manufacturing of an automobile: computer software is used in the creation, modification, analysis, and optimization of surgical approaches, and computer software and mechatronics are used to control and assist the execution of these surgical maneuvers. In other words, computer-integrated interventional medicine is the application of **Computer Aided Design** (CAS), **Computer Aided Manufacturing** (CAM), and **Total Quality Management** (TQM) to interventional medicine.\n",

    "## The Manufacturing Analogy in Clinical Practice\n",
    "Just as modern automotive manufacturing transforms raw materials into precision vechicles through engineering processes, computer-integrated interventional medicine transforms diagnostic information into therapeutic outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Automative Manufacturing**\n",
    "- **CAD**: Engineers create 3D models, run crash simulations, optiize aerodynamics,\n",
    "- **CAM**: Robotic assembly lines position components with sub-millimetre precision, and\n",
    "- **TQM**: Real-time sensors monitor quality, detect defects, trigger corrections.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Interventional Medicine**\n",
    "- **CAD**: Surgical planning. Surgeons creates a patient-specific plan that may includes 3D models of the patient anatomy, simulating procedures, and optimizing surgical approaches,\n",
    "- **CAM**: Surgical execution. Using advanced mechatronics such as surgical navigation system or medical robotics, guide surgical instruments with sub-millimetre accuracy to surgical targets, and\n",
    "- **TQM**: Surgical assessment. Surgical outcomes are recorded, complications identified, used to improve furture procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analogy extends beyond superficial similarities - both domains require integration of design software, precision tools, and quality assurance systems to achieve consistent, high-quality outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this regard, interventional medicine is treated, using engineering language, as a closed-loop process. This process of\n",
    "1. Combining specific information about the patient with the physician's general knowledge to determine the patient's condition,\n",
    "1. Formulating a plan of action,\n",
    "1. Carrying out this plan, and\n",
    "1. Evaluating the results has existed since ancient times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, these steps all have taken place in the physician's head: the ability of modern computer-based technology to assist humans in the processing and acting on complex information will profoundly enhance this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Computer Assisted Intervention (CAI)\n",
    "\n",
    "Interventional medicine typically takes place in three stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Planning**: For any patient, we need to\n",
    "   - Perform diagnosis: find out what is wrong. This is typically performed using aids from medical mechatronics (e.g. blood pressure monitor) and medical imaging (e.g. ultrasound and x-ray)\n",
    "   - Formulate a course of treatment: for example, if a patient has a tumour in the liver, should it be surgically removed, undergoing chemotherapy, or treated with thermal or chemical ablation?\n",
    "   - This **planning** stage corresponds to computer-aided design (CAD).\n",
    "1. **Execution**: Once the plan is formulated, how to make sure it was executed as planned? For example, if the course of treatment for a patient with liver tumour is thermal ablation, how do we place the ablation applicator at the intended location to ensure the complete tumor necrosis?\n",
    "   - This **Execution** stage, when assisted using computerized method, corresponds to computer-aided manufacturing (CAM).\n",
    "1. **Quality Control**: How do we know if what was planned and executed was effective? Past outcomes can be analyzed to provide insight for further surgery, thus the **quality control** is the feedback to this closed-loop process of CAI.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Technology Pillars of CAI\n",
    "Computer-assisted intervention rests on four foundational technology pillars:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Medical Imaging and Visualization\n",
    "Modern interventional medicine relies heavily on our ability to \"see inside\" the patient:\n",
    "- **Preoperative imaging** (X-ray, Computed Tomorography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, ultrasound) provides detailed anatomical information for surgical planning.\n",
    "- **Intraoperative imaging** (ultrasound, fluoroscopy) provides real-time updates during procedures,\n",
    "- **Mixed-reality systems** overlay enhances surgeon's view of the patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Surgical Navigation\n",
    "Akin to GPS for driving navigation, surgical navigation systems tracks surgical instruments relative to patient anatomy:\n",
    "- **Optical tracking system** uses camera to track markers on the patients or surgical instruments,\n",
    "- **Magnetic tracking system** enables localization of both rigid and flexible surgical instruments,\n",
    "- **Registration algorithms** align preoperative images with intraoperative reality,\n",
    "- **Calibration algorithms** maintains accuracy throughout dynamic procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Robotics and Mechatronics\n",
    "Robotic systems extend human capabilities in the operating room:\n",
    "- **Master-slave systems** filter tremor and scale motions for microsurgery,\n",
    "- **Haptic feedback devices** provide forse sensation for remote manipulation,\n",
    "- **Specialized end-effectors** perform tasks that are traditionally difficult for human operator to perform, and\n",
    "- **Autonomous subsystems** handle routine tasks while surgeons focus on critical decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Philosophy and Learning Approach\n",
    "this course adopts a system engineering perspective on surgical navigation, emphasizing:\n",
    "### Theoretical Foundation\n",
    "- **Linear Algebra** for data representation and coordinate transformation,\n",
    "- **Computer Graphics** for 2D and 3D visualization \n",
    "- **Augmented Reality**: 3D visualization and human-computer interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## About This Course: Focus on Surgical Execution\n",
    "While computer-integrated interventional medicine encompasses the entire planning-execution-assessment cycle, this course provides deep expertise in the execution phaseâ€”specifically, surgical navigation systems that serve as \"GPS for surgery.\"\n",
    "### What We Cover In Depth:\n",
    "- Real-time tracking technologies: Optical, electromagnetic, and inertial systems\n",
    "- Registration algorithms: Aligning preoperative plans with intraoperative reality\n",
    "- Navigation interfaces: Displaying guidance information to surgical teams\n",
    "- Accuracy assessment: Methods for measuring and maintaining system performance\n",
    "- Integration challenges: Connecting navigation systems with OR workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Touch Upon:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Planning systems: How surgical plans are created (inputs to navigation systems)\n",
    "- Quality assessment: How navigation accuracy affects outcomes (outputs from navigation systems)\n",
    "- Broader CAI context: Where navigation fits in the complete intervention cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Don't Cover:\n",
    "- Medical imaging physics: Detailed CT/MRI acquisition and reconstruction\n",
    "- Robotic control theory: Low-level motor control and kinematics\n",
    "- Clinical medicine: Diagnosis and treatment selection\n",
    "- Healthcare economics: Detailed cost-effectiveness analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This focused approach allows us to develop deep expertise in surgical navigation while maintaining awareness of the broader CAI ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this course, we focus on the **execution** of the surgical plan in an interventional surgical suite. That is, we want to develop computerized techniques to make sure that surgical plans, defined by the interventionists (e.g. surgeons or interventional radiologists), are performed as intended. Our approach is to develop a **surgical navigational system**, e.g. **GPS for surgery**, to guide the execution of surgical maneuvers.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
