    "According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the definition of the word [**Surgery**](https://www.oed.com/dictionary/surgery_n?tab=meaning_and_use#19777282) includes, among others:\n",
    "- The art or practice of treating wounds, fractured bones, and other conditions by manual operation or instrumental appliances; surgical treatment, and\n",
    "- Surgery of Access.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, the word **surgery** is associated with surgical *incisions*. Take the [hepatectomy](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22930-hepatectomy-liver-resection) procedure as an exampleâ€”possible surgical approaches include:\n",
    "\n",

If you're having laparoscopic surgery, your surgeon will make 4 to 6 \"keyhole\" incisions, which they'll use to place the camera (laparoscope) and surgical instruments to do the operation."
